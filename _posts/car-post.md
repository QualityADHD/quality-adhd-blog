This post is the first update written by Shaun. The rest of the posts are generated by NextJS, however I will be adding more posts as I upload more code to GitHub.

## What is the goal of this blog?

The goal of this blog is to write about current code that I am learning about and showcase the skills that I have learned around frontend development, test automation, AI, and more. I plan on keeping this updated on a regular basis, as this is going to basically be my business card for companies that I apply to.
