# What is this blog for?

I made this blog as a quick way to get back into coding and to get re-familiar with core frontend code concepts. I chose Next.js and Vercel due to the speed of deployment and ramp-up time. It uses Next.js, Markdown, Tailwind, and Typescript to be a quick and efficient way to get new posts out quickly.

# What changed from the base template?

I have went in and added a few new things, such as a new author, site branding, posts, data-a-targets, and updated some of the CSS. I plan on adding additional new components, such as an author component which will contain some of my details. This blog is specifically focused on code and engineering thoughts, but I am also building a site based on Wordpress for my art business (more info on that will be coming soon).
